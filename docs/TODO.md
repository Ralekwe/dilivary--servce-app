# TODO 

- **Pictures** could be added for all types of **users** (for example, add a new field in DB table).
- **Client applications store cache and session tokens**, so create mechanism for data replication (backend to client app).
- **Communication between services** using **message broker** could be possible only if each backend service has its own database.
- Add **JWT** + **Microsoft** and **Google** OAuth-based authentication.
- When communicating through the network, sometimes you can use the idea of **pipelining**:
