### Step-by-step execution plan of the process

- The warehouse receives a notification:
    - List of required starting products and their quantity/weight/volume.
- A manual check is carried out to ensure that the quantity/weight/volume of the required starting products corresponds to their actual quantity/weight/volume.
- If there are not enough real products, then the warehouse employee must fix this in the application (the database is updated) and start the [Deliver from store to warehouse](../delivering/store2wh.md) process.
    - Also at this stage, the manager is notified (since this is a planning / accounting collision of products)
- If there are enough real products, then write off the required amount, take them to the kitchen and close the process.
- Receive delivery requests from the kitchen
- Select the products needed for the delivery
- Prepare the products for transport, such as packing them into boxes or crates
- Update delivery status to indicate that the products have been picked up and are en route to the kitchen
