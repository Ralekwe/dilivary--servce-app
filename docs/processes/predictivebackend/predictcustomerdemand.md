### Step-by-step execution plan of the process

- Run an SQL query to obtain historical sales data (data in the database appears through replication/migration from the backend service [customerbackend](../../backend/customerbackend.ru.md)).
- The following data sampling criteria may be applied:
    - by dates/months/years (to identify seasonal dependencies and forecasting);
    - by the time when the order is made (to identify the dependence of the time of day on the quantity of ordered products).
- Use time series forecasting and regression analysis methods to anticipate future demand for specific products or services
- Optimize inventory management based on predicted demand
