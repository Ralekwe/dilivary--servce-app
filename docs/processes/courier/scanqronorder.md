Name: **Scan QR code on order**.

The scenario responsible for scanning QR code on order before delivering by couriers involves using a mobile app or handheld scanner to scan a unique QR code associated with each order. 
This verifies that the correct order is being delivered and provides real-time tracking information to the delivery service company and the customer.

Process pattern: [delivering](../../processpatterns/delivering.md)

Responsible modules: [client application](../../frontend/courierclient.md), [backend service](../../backend/courierbackend.md)
