# processes

[English](README.md) | [Русский](README.ru.md)

A [business process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process) is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks performed by people or equipment in which a specific sequence produces a service or product (serves a particular business goal) for a particular customer or customers. 

A [business process](../processes/README.md) on this platform is understood as a rather simple and isolated sequence of actions.
In the case of complex coordination between processes, it is better to distinguish the so-called [flowchart steps](../flowchartsteps/README.md), or steps of a flowchart diagram (for example, complete order processing, preparation, delivery and payment in a general sense can be considered as one flowchart diagram).

## BPMN

BPMN has been designed to provide a standard notation readily understandable by all business stakeholders, typically including business analysts, technical developers and business managers. BPMN can therefore be used to support the generally desirable aim of all stakeholders on a project adopting a common language to describe processes, helping to avoid communication gaps that can arise between business process design and implementation.

Diagrams of this type show in more detail the interaction between services, as well as the specific actions that are necessary to complete a business process.
