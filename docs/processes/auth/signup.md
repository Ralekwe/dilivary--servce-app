### Step-by-step execution

- User opens the customer client side app
- User clicks on the "Sign Up" button
- User enters their personal information, such as name, email address, and password
- App validates the user's information and checks if the email address is already registered
- If the information is valid and the email address is not already registered, the app creates a new account for the user and grants them access to the app's features and functionality
- If there are any errors or issues with the user's information, the app displays an error message and prompts the user to correct their information before proceeding.
