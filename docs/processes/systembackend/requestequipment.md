### Step-by-step execution

- A kitchen employee notices that a piece of equipment is broken or malfunctioning.

- The employee fills out a form with details about the broken equipment and submits the request.
- The system checks if the inventory or equipment is available in the warehouse.
- If it is available, the system sends a notification to the warehouse employee to prepare it for delivery.
- If it is not available, the system sends a notification to the manager to order it.
- The request is received by the manager, who reviews it and approves or denies the request.
