The survey business process in a delivery service app involves collecting feedback from customers, delivery personnel, or other stakeholders to gather insights, assess satisfaction levels, and identify areas for improvement. 

This process typically includes designing survey questionnaires, distributing surveys through various channels (such as email or app notifications), collecting responses, analyzing data, and taking action based on survey findings. 

The goal is to continuously improve service quality, customer experience, and operational efficiency based on feedback gathered through surveys.
