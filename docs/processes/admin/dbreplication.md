## Data structures

### Objects 

- Database information model: This model could include properties such as database name, server location, and replication status. It could also have methods for managing database data.
- Replication configuration model: This model could include properties such as replication method, replication frequency, and replication targets. It could also have methods for managing replication configurations.
