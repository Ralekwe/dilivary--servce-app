Name: **Load balancing**.

The process responsible for deploying load balancing in the delivery service app involves setting up load balancer devices or software to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers or resources. This ensures that no single server becomes overwhelmed with requests and helps optimize resource utilization and response times.

Responsible modules: [client application](../../frontend/adminclient.md), [backend service](../../backend/adminbackend.md)

## Process description

Load balancing can be implemented by providing clients with the address of the load balancer itself, which then redirects requests to backend services. This method allows for centralized control and flexibility in managing backend resources. However, it may introduce a single point of failure if the load balancer goes down.

Other strategies to implement load balancing include using DNS-based load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers based on DNS resolution, implementing server-based load balancing using software or hardware on individual servers, and using content-based routing to direct traffic based on specific attributes of the incoming requests. Each method has its own pros and cons in terms of performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.
