Name: **Telephony**.

As far as I know, telephony includes the development, application, and deployment of telecommunication services but I have no idea how it could be implemented. I guess it means that I need to implement the following business processes: 
- creating and deploying the network of telephones, 
- register and process calls, e.g. storing the history of communications between clients in the DB (clients involved in the conversation, when the communication started and finished),
- watching for problems in the network of clients. 
Please, tell me if I understand the business processes correctly. Also it would be nice if you list some other business process that could be implemented to deal with telephony. 

In addition to the processes you mentioned, other business processes that could be implemented to deal with telephony include call routing and forwarding, managing voicemail systems, and implementing interactive voice response (IVR) systems.

To enhance your knowledge in VoIP and IP telephony, you can start by learning about the basics of VoIP technology, understanding how it differs from traditional telephony, and familiarizing yourself with the protocols and standards used in IP telephony such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol).
