## Process description

In a microservice architecture, each microservice may have its own cache that stores data from external services or databases. 

When data in those external services or databases changes, the microservice needs to clear its cache to ensure that it has the most up-to-date data. 
This can be triggered by events or messages sent from the external services or databases.
