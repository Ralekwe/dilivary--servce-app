Name: **Implementing quality of service (QoS) for prioritizing network traffic**.

The process responsible for implementing quality of service (QoS) in the delivery service app involves prioritizing certain types of network traffic to ensure that critical applications or services receive adequate bandwidth and low latency. This can be achieved through traffic shaping, packet prioritization, and bandwidth allocation mechanisms.

Responsible modules: [client application](../../frontend/adminclient.md), [backend service](../../backend/adminbackend.md)

## Process description

### Step-by-step execution

- Identify the need for QoS based on network traffic and application requirements.
- Research and select a suitable QoS solution.
- Configure the QoS solution to prioritize traffic based on predefined rules.
- Test the QoS configuration to ensure it is working as expected.
- Monitor the performance of the QoS solution and make adjustments as needed.
