Name: **Minor change request**.

It can be beneficial to separate change requests based on the scale of changes required. 
For example, large-scale change requests that involve architectural solutions or significant work could be categorized as [major change requests](../admin/majorchangerequest.md), while smaller changes such as database modifications or minor updates could be categorized as [minor change requests](../admin/minorchangerequest.md). 
This can help in prioritizing and managing change requests more effectively.
