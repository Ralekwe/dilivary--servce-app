Name: **Optimize delivery**.

The scenario responsible for optimizing delivery process by manager in the delivery service company involves analyzing data on delivery times, routes, and other factors to identify areas for improvement, implementing changes to improve efficiency and reduce costs, and monitoring performance to ensure continuous improvement.

Process pattern: [requesting](../../processpatterns/requesting.md)

Responsible modules: [client application](../../frontend/managerclient.md), [backend service](../../backend/managerbackend.md).

Platform version: v0.4

### Step-by-step execution

- Manager opens the app.
- Manager selects "Optimize Delivery Process" option.
- The manager selects the option to optimize delivery process.
- The app displays real-time data on delivery times, driver routes, and order volume.
- The system analyzes delivery data and identifies areas for improvement.
- The system provides recommendations for improving delivery process.
- The manager reviews the recommendations and takes appropriate action.
- The manager can use this data to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the delivery process.
- The manager can adjust driver schedules or routes to improve delivery times.
- The manager can also use data to forecast demand and adjust staffing levels accordingly.

## Data structures

### Objects 

- Delivery routes model: This model could include properties such as starting point, ending point, and distance. It could also have methods for optimizing delivery routes.
- [Address](https://github.com/alexeysp11/workflow-lib/blob/main/src/Models/Business/Address.cs): could be considered as a customer locations model.
- Delivery times model: This model could include properties such as estimated delivery time and delivery window. It could also have methods for optimizing delivery times.
