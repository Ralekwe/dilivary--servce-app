### Step-by-step execution plan of the process

- The request goes to the backend service, which provides the work of a specialist who must carry out the approval.
- The specialist is notified using [notificationsbackend](../../backend/notificationsbackend.ru.md).
- The request is sent to the client application, where it is saved in the database.
- The employee enters the application and approves or does not approve the request.
- The approval results are saved on the client application and on the backend service.
- If necessary, employees who are on the notification list are notified.
