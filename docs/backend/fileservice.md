Service description:
- Upload files to the server (images, videos, Word, Excel, PDF)
- Download files from the server (images, Word, Excel, PDF)
- Generation of a QR code for payment

Technical description of the service:
- It is possible to make only one method for the service (input parameters: session token, file type, values for generating a file; output parameters: session token, uid of the generated file, file type, file body as an array of bytes)
- uid of the generated file is needed so that the generated file can be cached and easily found in the database
- Saves generated file
- From the point of view of this service, there is no difference whether files are uploaded to the server or from it
- It is necessary to provide in the system the ability to save files on a separate dedicated server and periodically clean the file system from the created files: since the system processes a large number of requests, a lot of files are also created, respectively, there is a risk of running out of hard disk space.

Possible restrictions:
- Number of frames per second: 24/30 fps
