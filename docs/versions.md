# versions

[English](versions.md) | [Русский](versions.ru.md)

The reason for increasing the major version of the project may be, for example, the transfer of some part of the functionality from this project to the shared library [workflow-lib](https://github.com/alexeysp11/workflow-lib) or preparation for this kind of transferring.

Versions:
- **v1.x**: the initial version of the platform, which includes all the basic functionality.
- **v2.x**: is transitional, since part of the functionality implemented in **v1.x** is transferred to the library [workflow-lib](https://github.com/alexeysp11/workflow-lib), at the same time, the old implementation of the functionality is also stored on the platform, but is marked as obsolete. Thus, it is assumed to use the implementation from the library [workflow-lib](https://github.com/alexeysp11/workflow-lib) instead of the outdated one.
- **v3.x**: version that completes the transition to the [workflow-lib](https://github.com/alexeysp11/workflow-lib) library. The deprecated implementation is no longer available.
