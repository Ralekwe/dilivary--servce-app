A **delivery service app** is an ERP platform that enables users to order and receive goods. 
The app includes features such as browsing products, selecting delivery options, tracking orders in real-time, and making payments.

## Overall description 

### Goal 

The goals of the delivery service app in general are to provide a convenient and efficient way for customers to order and receive deliveries, while also streamlining the process for businesses and couriers involved in the delivery process.

The goals of the project are to develop a comprehensive delivery service app that meets the needs of all stakeholders involved in the delivery process, including customers, businesses, couriers, and managers. 
This includes developing client side apps for each user type, as well as backend services to support authentication, files, statistics, prediction, email sending, and push notifications.

### Scope 

The scope of the project includes developing a full-stack delivery service app that can handle all aspects of the delivery process, from customer orders to courier deliveries. 
This includes developing client side apps for six different user types, as well as backend services to support authentication, files, statistics, prediction, email sending, and push notifications.

### Who can use this app 

The application is designed to be used by customers, businesses, couriers, and managers involved in the delivery process. 
Any company that offers delivery services could potentially use this application, including restaurants, grocery stores, retail stores, and other businesses that offer delivery services.
